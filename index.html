      Hi! My name is Bee and I use she/her pronouns.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah alongside three siblings.
      I graduated from Skyline High School in 2018 with an International Baccalaureate
      Diploma. Currently, I am a senior at the University of Puget Sound, studying
      computer science alongside classes in math, chemistry, and biology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of academics, I love to play all sports involving running, hike
      the Utah mountains, and sing just about anything.
      In my time at UPS, I have been a member of our women's choir, played varsity
      lacrosse, and held executive positions in my sorority--Gamma Phi Beta.
      Around campus, I can be found doting over my leopard gecko Stumpy and savoring
      an unhealthy amount of coffee.
